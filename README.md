Hi there...

About

This was my very first project, and I am very proud of it!

I designed this program for a business with task-based staff. It helps both employees and managers keep track of their tasks efficiently. I built this project using Python, showcasing my creative thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to write clean and efficient code.

During development, I encountered several challenges, but with the guidance of a mentor, I learned how to debug effectively and navigate errors. This experience helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, which I carried forward into future projects.

How It Works:

The program operates through a simple login system that requires a username and password. Once logged in, users are presented with a menu that allows them to:

View existing tasks and
Add new tasks

How to Run the Programme:

Open any code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.
Copy the code from the task_manager.py file and paste it into the editor. Save the file as a python file
Create two other text files:
user.txt: Contains usernames and passwords. (Copy the contents from the user file.)
tasks.txt: Stores task information. (Copy the contents from the tasks file.)
Ensure all files are in the same directory.
Run task_manager.py to start the program.

 I hope you appreciate the creativity and efficiency of my code. As this was my first project, I am excited to showcase my growth with my next project: Tracker App.
