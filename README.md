Hi there..

This was my very first project in which i'm very proud of 

About:

 This project was desinged for a business that hass staff that work task related. 
 So this programme was designed to help staff and manager to keep track of their tasks. 
 I created this programme with python and it shows my creative thinking and problem solving as well my skill in clean and efficient code.
 I came accross some barriers during the creation of this project but with guidence of a mentor i was abble to overcome it.
 With the help of the mentor i was able to learn how to navigate errors/problems and work my way through it by debugging and problemm solving 


 The programme works by logging into with a username and password.
 Soon after that you are given a menu with the options to viewing and adding tasks.
 
steps to view programme:

 You are able to see how the programme works by using any code editor such ass Visual Studio Code.
 Copy the code from the task manager file and paste it to the code editor and save it as a pyhon file.
 Create 2 other text files...
 One being the user file with the usernames and passwords (copy text from the user file)
 and the other being the task file  (copy text from the user file).
 Now that you have all the files run the task manager file .

 I hope you get to see the the code style creativity and efficiency fore it is my first ever project and hope to show the progression when viewing the next project: Tracker app
